Given the simplifications we carried out, we find a result in agreement with the [GW170814 discovery paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.09660.pdf) which reported a $p$-value of 0.3%.\n","\n","Had the signal been much louder in the Virgo data, the Virgo peak would be larger than any peak in the noise background. In this case, this method of estimating the significance would only be able to set an upper bound on the $p$-value of the observed peak. In order to calculate the $p$-value of a much larger peak, we would either need to use more background data or make additional assumptions about the background distribution. If a gravitational-wave signal is extremely loud, it is challenging to calculate the precise significance of the observed peak, but we can still be confident that the signal is very significant! "]}]}
